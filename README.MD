# GAME DEV COLLAB

We are utilizing 64pixel art style

## Our goals are as follows

- 2D game
- Weapon control (with mouse)
- ~~2D movement (with WASD)~~
- enemies should be able to move around (maybe using a nav mesh)
- different elevation/~~obstacles~~
- menus (pause menus and inventory menus, see terraria?)
- graphical overlay (like terraria)
- ~~static level (we will make a generated level later)~~
- minimap

### for later we will do

- Quests (these will be more gameplay than talking, no talking if possible, similar to bounties in GW2)
- bosses from the quests
- varying enemies (diff sizes, etc)

## SOTG: State Of The Game NOV 4 8PM

As of writing this, we have made quite a bit of progress since we started development earlier this week. At the moment we have:
- An animated barebones player with WASD control
  - includes animation: forwards and backwards walking in the right and left directions
  - walks with WASD
  - looks at mouse
- Ground textures:
  - grass
  - path
- props - static objects with hitboxes:
  - fences
  - a shrub with rocks
- A map
- the first enemy: a green slime
  - as of writing this, the green slime has no AI of any kind, but has an animated jump that has amazing fluidity, courtesy of @Xethrus
