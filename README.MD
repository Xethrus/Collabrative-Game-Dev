# GAME DEV COLLAB

We are utilizing 64pixel art style

## Our goals are as follows

- 2D game
- Weapon control (with mouse)
- 2D movement (with WASD)
- enemies should be able to move around (maybe using a nav mesh)
- different elevation/obstacles
- menus (pause menus and inventory menus, see terraria?)
- graphical overlay (like terraria)
- static level (we will make a generated level later)
- minimap

### for later we will do
- Quests (these will be more gameplay than talking, no talking if possible, similar to bounties in GW2)
- bosses from the quests
- varying enemies (diff sizes, etc)
